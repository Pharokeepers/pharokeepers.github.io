This week I have worked on many different things. One of which is revising my knowledge about graph structure. There is a numbere of sources I have used and heard of, but the one I found most interesting and complete is [Algorithms, Fourth edition](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. This book offers more than just words and pictures, there are also code implementations in Java for many algorithms.

This inspired me to look for already existing implementations of graph structure in [Pharo](https://pharo.org/). I am interested in knowing what exactly was needed, which kind of traversing algorithms or types of graphs. My idea is to implement a library that will be easy to switch to, even if you have already been using something else and you need to change your code. I have started this research and will continue it next week.

I spend some time in consulting with my mentors about the structure of the library I will be implementing. As well as writing some steps of the wiki page *Setting up a new project*. When they include my text, I will post a link to it. :smile: 

One of the things that created a bit of an issue for me this week, was posting [my first Pharo code](https://github.com/medicka/My-Pharo) on [GitHub](https://github.com/).I have never done it before, so naturally first I did some research. 

But even though I followed the instruction correctly, it was not always working for me. After a lot of trying and a bit of getting annoyed :worried:, I asked for some help. It turned out my problem was mostly that I am using Windows. For this operating system there are some special rules. Talking to some fellow students, I noticed that a lot of them had the same problem. This gave me an idea, to include the helpful hints I learned and was given in my next blog post. So next week is not going to be about my project, but about some things you need to know when using Pharo on Windows. :smile:
